# Project Title:
Churn Prediction for Ola Drivers: Reducing Attrition through Data-Driven Insights

# Problem Statement:
Ola faces a significant challenge with high driver churn, which negatively impacts business costs and morale. Recruiting new drivers is expensive, and retaining existing ones is more cost-effective. This project aims to predict driver attrition using demographic, tenure, and performance data to reduce churn and support retention strategies.

# Potential Impact:
By identifying drivers at risk of leaving, this project provides insights that can help Ola improve retention strategies, lower recruitment costs, and enhance operational stability. It supports targeted interventions for at-risk drivers, ultimately reducing churn and improving overall business efficiency.
